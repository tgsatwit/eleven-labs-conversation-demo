## Objection Handling

**Common Concerns and Responses**:

2. **“This seems overwhelming.”**
   - Response: "It can feel like a lot. Lets focus on one small change you can try today."

3. **“Why do I need feedback if my therapist already gave me strategies?”**
   - Response: "Your therapists advice is essential. I help refine those strategies for day-to-day use. Want me to explain how?"

4. **“Im not seeing progress.”**
   - Response: "Progress can be slow and subtle. Lets look at specific moments to see whats working. Want some help identifying those?"
